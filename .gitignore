# Database (Optional: Upload if you want to keep users, ignore if you want fresh DB)
# surebets.db
# Keeping DB in repo is usually bad practice for frequent writes, but for this simple bot it might be okay for initial state.
# However, Render file system is ephemeral, so DB changes won't persist across deploys unless using a Volume.
# For now, let's allow it so user keeps their settings, but warn about persistence.
# actually, let's ignore it to force fresh creation or volume usage, BUT user has data.
# Let's Upload it for now so they don't start empty.
